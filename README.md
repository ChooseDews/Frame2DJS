# Frame2D.JS

Frame elements can be thought of as connected welded bars, or more accurately as a continuous homogeneous material. At these connections, both forces and moments can be transferred between elements, which is different compared to the truss element where the nodes are considered pins that can only transfer forces.

This web-based program allows you to enter nodes, connections, and boundry conditions into a visual interface. These data points are solved and an exaggerated displacment are shown to the user, as well as the global results. The system solves for the nodal displacements, angle, and reaction forces of the problem.
